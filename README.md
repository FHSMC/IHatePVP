Keep Inventory for PVP servers in order to discourage PVP.

When a player is killed by another player, this plugin enables keep inventory for that player, allowing them to keep their items. When a player is killed by non-player related means, such as falling from a high place, they will lose their items. This plugin is to prevent peope from randomly attacking other people, and should they do so, reward them with nothing.
